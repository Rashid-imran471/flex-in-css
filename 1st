CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two distinct layout models in CSS, each designed for different types of layout and alignment tasks. Here are the main differences between them and when to use one over the other:

**CSS Flexbox:**
1. **One-Dimensional Layout:** Flexbox is primarily used for one-dimensional layouts, such as arranging items in a row or a column. It's perfect for creating flexible and dynamic layouts where you want to control the alignment and distribution of items along a single axis.

2. **Child Alignment:** It excels at aligning and distributing items along the main axis (either horizontally or vertically) while allowing for flexibility on the cross-axis. This is great for aligning content within a container.

3. **Unequal Sizing:** Flexbox allows items to have unequal sizes, depending on their content or specified dimensions, while distributing the available space effectively.

4. **Order Control:** You can easily change the order of items, reordering them without altering the source order in the HTML.

5. **Implicit Row or Column Management:** Flexbox does not have a grid structure. It simply lays out items along a single axis, creating a dynamic and flexible flow.

**When to Use Flexbox:**
- When you need to align items within a container along a single axis (row or column).
- For creating navigation menus, centering elements, or building flexible card layouts.
- When the content's size varies, and you want to make optimal use of available space.

**CSS Grid:**
1. **Two-Dimensional Layout:** CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, making it ideal for creating grid structures with rows and columns. It enables precise control over both the rows and columns of the grid.

2. **Cell Control:** Grid allows you to place items in specific cells of the grid, making it great for creating grid-based designs with fixed positions for items.

3. **Equal-Sized Rows and Columns:** Grid enforces equal-sized rows and columns by default, making it suitable for creating consistently structured layouts.

4. **Grid Gap:** You can easily define gaps (margins) between rows and columns using the `grid-gap` property.

5. **Explicit Grid Definition:** Grid requires you to define the structure of your layout explicitly by specifying the number of rows and columns.

**When to Use Grid:**
- When you need a grid-based layout for tasks like building complex web page layouts, card-based UIs, or responsive designs.
- For situations where you want fine-grained control over the placement of items in specific grid cells.
- When you need to create consistent, equal-sized rows and columns.
